- 👋 Hi, I’m @GreenbanditMZrider. I used to have a Green Suzuki Bandit 1200, and my first motorbike was an MZ TS150.
- 👀 I’m interested in Raspberry Pi programming, Arduino programming, Roblox BeeSwarm Simulator, using Raspberry Pi4B units as 24/7 minecraft servers for family & friends.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Wado Ryo Karate
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects if I can help, but I don't have the time to get into programming much.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Xbox chat (same username)
